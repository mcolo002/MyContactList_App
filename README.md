    Application title: MyContactList App
    The app should allow the storing of the contact list.
    This is a very simple database app. As shown in Figure 1, there are two buttons ON and SAVE. If you click the ON button, you can enter the contact person's name, address, city, state, and zip code. Then click the SAVE button to save the input information to the list. Finally, if you want to see the list, click the picture icon with the pen and note on it, and the save list will appear as shown in Figure 2. Also, in Figure 2 there is a DELETE button to delete the selected list.
